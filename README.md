# Airbnb Clone  

## Overview  
This Airbnb clone is a React-based full-stack application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. It allows users to browse, view, and rent places while providing a clean, responsive UI. The app uses hardcoded data for listings but integrates hooks and services to simulate CRUD operations, giving it a dynamic and interactive feel. The backend is deployed on Render, enabling hosting and server-side functionality.  

# Note  
This project is hosted on the free tier of Render.  
The server may take **30–60 seconds** to spin up when you first open the link.  
Please be patient and refresh the page if it doesn’t load immediately.
